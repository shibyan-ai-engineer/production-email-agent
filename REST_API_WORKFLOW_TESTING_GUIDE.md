# Email Assistant HITL REST API Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive workflows for testing the `/process-email-hitl` endpoint with memory features. The system uses three memory namespaces that learn from user interactions:

- **`triage_preferences`**: Learn which emails to ignore/notify/respond to
- **`response_preferences`**: Learn user's email writing style and preferences  
- **`cal_preferences`**: Learn user's meeting scheduling preferences

## üîß Prerequisites

1. **Redis Server**: Ensure Redis is running on `localhost:6379`
2. **API Server**: Start the FastAPI server on `localhost:8000`
3. **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000/process-email-hitl`

## üìã Core Request/Response Schemas

### Start New Workflow Request
```json
{
  "email": {
    "author": "sender@example.com",
    "to": "lance@langchain.com", 
    "subject": "Email Subject",
    "email_thread": "Email content..."
  }
}
```

### Resume Workflow Request
```json
{
  "thread_id": "uuid-from-previous-response",
  "human_response": {
    "type": "accept|edit|ignore|response",
    "args": { /* optional args for edit/response */ }
  }
}
```

### Response Schema
```json
{
  "status": "interrupted|completed",
  "thread_id": "uuid-string",
  "interrupt": {  // Only when status = "interrupted"
    "action": "tool_name",
    "args": { /* tool arguments */ },
    "description": "Human-readable description",
    "allowed_actions": ["accept", "edit", "ignore", "response"]
  },
  "result": {  // Only when status = "completed"
    "classification": "ignore|notify|respond",
    "response": "Action taken",
    "reasoning": "Why this action was taken"
  }
}
```

## üîç Memory Verification Workflows

### Check Thread State (During Workflow)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/process-email-hitl/{thread_id}
```

### Memory Persistence Test
1. Complete a full workflow with memory updates
2. Restart the API server
3. Send a similar email type - verify the system remembers previous decisions

### Memory Evolution Test
1. Send newsletter ‚Üí Human ignores ‚Üí Check triage memory
2. Send different newsletter ‚Üí Verify auto-classification as "ignore"
3. Send technical email ‚Üí Human responds ‚Üí Check response memory  
4. Send similar technical email ‚Üí Verify improved response quality

---

## üìä Expected Memory Updates

### Triage Preferences Memory Updates
- **After ignoring newsletters**: Learns to auto-classify promotional emails as "ignore"
- **After responding to admin notifications**: Learns to classify system alerts as "respond"
- **After handling meeting requests**: Learns which meeting types need responses

### Response Preferences Memory Updates  
- **After editing emails**: Learns user's preferred tone, structure, and language style
- **After providing feedback**: Incorporates specific response patterns and requirements
- **After accepting/ignoring responses**: Reinforces or corrects assistant behavior

### Calendar Preferences Memory Updates
- **After editing meeting durations**: Learns preferred meeting lengths
- **After modifying meeting details**: Learns scheduling preferences and constraints
- **After ignoring certain meeting types**: Learns meeting priority patterns

---

## üöÄ Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-Step Learning
1. Start with default preferences
2. Process 3-5 emails with human feedback
3. Send similar email types to verify learning
4. Check memory evolution through thread state API

### Scenario 2: Memory Conflict Resolution
1. Provide conflicting feedback on similar emails
2. Verify system updates memory appropriately
3. Test edge cases with ambiguous classifications

### Scenario 3: Long-Term Memory Persistence
1. Build up memory over multiple sessions
2. Restart Redis/API services  
3. Verify memory persists and continues learning

This comprehensive guide enables you to test all aspects of the HITL workflow while observing how the system learns and adapts to user preferences through the memory system.
